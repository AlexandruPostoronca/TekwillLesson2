<h2>Starting with GitHub</h2>
<p><strong>GitHub</strong> is a code hosting platform. It is a place where developers can store their projects and work
    together to develop new projects. It's easier to control program versions and collaborate this way.
    <strong>GitHub</strong> is based on a popular version control system called <strong>Git</strong>, and provides some
    additional features such as a web interface, collaboration tools, an issue tracker, project statistics, and more.
</p>
<p>By 2020, <strong>GitHub</strong> is the largest host of source code in the world. You may find many popular
    open-source projects hosted on GitHub and make your contribution.</p>
<p>In this lesson, you will learn how to start using GitHub through your web browser. We recommend you to repeat
    everything that we do here step by step.</p>

<h4>Creating an account on GitHub</h4>
<p>To complete this lesson, first, you need to create a free account on
    <a href="https://github.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a> (or use an
    existing one). The profile is your public page on GitHub just like your social network profile. When you're looking
    for a job as a programmer, potential employers might check your GitHub profile and take it into account as they
    consider you for the job.</p>
<p>When you create an account, in the last step choose "Continue for free":</p>

<p>After you complete the registration, you will see a dashboard. At the top of the page, you will find the search box
    and information about your profile.</p>
<img alt="" src="2.3.2.png" width="600" style="margin: auto;">
<p>You can open <strong>your profile</strong> and make changes (for example, you can add a bio or upload a picture).</p>

<h4>Exploring a repository</h4>
<p><strong>GitHub</strong> hosts millions of projects written in different programming languages. Each project is placed
    in its own container called a <strong>repository</strong> <strong>(repo)</strong> that can store code,
    configurations, datasets, pictures, and other files included in your project. Any changes to the files within a repo
    will be tracked via version control.
</p>
<p>Just after you have got your account you do not have any repositories. In order to create one, type "Create a
    repository" and follow the instructions.
</p>
<p>If you want to find some specific repository of a project, type its name or part of the name in the search box. You
    will see a list of suitable repositories.</p>
<img alt="" src="2.3.3.png" width="600" style="margin: auto;">
<p>Sometimes, the name of a repository might be too long or there may be lots of repositories with the same name. For
    example, try searching for <strong>intro-to-github</strong> without <strong>hyperskill/</strong>.</p>
<p>Usually, you have a link to a repository. Many open-source projects publish links on their personal websites, or your
    colleagues may give you a link to a repository of a project.</p>
<p>Here is the direct link to our existing
    <a href="https://github.com/hyperskill/intro-to-github/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">
        demo repository</a>. Go ahead and open this repo and take a look at its internal structure.</p>
<img alt="" src="2.3.4.png" width="600" style="margin: auto;">

<div class="alert alert-primary">From October 1, 2020,
    <a href="https://github.com/github/renaming" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">the master
    branch on GitHub has been renamed to main</a>. Now, in all repositories that will be created, the main branch will
    be called main, the old repositories created before October this year remain unchanged.
</div>
<p>There are two files in the <strong>Code</strong> tab. <strong>README.md</strong> is a file that describes the
    project; every repository should have this file. GitHub finds this file and displays its content below the repo. The
    other file is <strong>.gitignore</strong>; it specifies which files and directories Git should ignore.</p>
<p>Although this repo is public, you cannot modify files in this repo directly, because you have read-only access to any
    public repository. To modify the files, you must be a <strong>collaborator</strong> on this project.</p>
<p>The <strong>Pull requests</strong> tab contains proposals for changes in the files that are in the repository
    (adding, deleting, or modifying files). The owners of the repo can review a request and approve your changes if they
    are good enough.</p>
<p>You can create an <strong>Issue</strong> or make a <strong>Pull request (PR)</strong> to contribute to the project,
    even if you are not a collaborator.</p>
<p>In our project, the <strong>Wiki</strong> tab is empty, but it is actually where the documentation of the project
    (how to use it, how it was designed, its core principles, and so on) should be stored. Whereas a
    <strong>README.md</strong> is to quickly let readers know what your project can do, wikis help provide additional
    information.</p>
<p>We don't discuss the <strong>Projects</strong> tab in this lesson.</p>
<p>In the <strong>Insight</strong> tab you can find stats and information about the repository.</p>
<p>You may also look at the<strong> commit(s)</strong> which represent changes in the content of the repo. Here is a <a
        href="https://github.com/hyperskill/intro-to-github/commits/master" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"
        target="_blank">link</a> to see it directly. We will learn more about commits further on.</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p><strong>GitHub</strong> is a web platform where people can store their projects as Git-repos. Using their web
    interface, you can create an account, a repo and search for repos of other projects. Every repo on the platform has
    several tabs inside, such as <strong>Code</strong> with <strong>README.md</strong> file, <strong>Pull
        requests</strong> where you can offer changes in the files, the <strong>Wiki</strong> tab with project
    documentation and <strong>Insights </strong>with statistics about the repository.</p>
