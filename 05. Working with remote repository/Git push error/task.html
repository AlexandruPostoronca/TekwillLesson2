<h2>Git push error</h2>

<p>Marina made a <code>git push</code> to send her changes to the server. But Katie had already made many new commits before her. As a result, Marina got an error message <code>git push rejected</code>. Which command will help Marina fix everything and repeat the submission later?</p>
