<h2>Working with remote repository</h2>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>
    <span>Imagine you and your dream team are developing a large and complex project. You decided to divide it into
        parts so that everyone could concentrate on doing one of them. And in the end, you plan to join forces.
        What is the best way to do it? The simplest approach is to set up a remote repository to which everyone will
        upload their versions. This way, you won't be confused by the new code versions and will not lose important features.
    </span>
</p>
<p>
    <span>In other words, when someone completes one part of the project, the new data is uploaded to the remote
    repository. After you've updated the data, the other team member may download it and continue working on it.
    </span>
</p>
<p>
    There are useful commands,<strong>git clone</strong>, <strong>git push</strong>, and <strong>git pull</strong>,
    <span>to upload and download data from there. Let's take a look at how they all work.</span>
</p>
<h4>Git clone</h4>
<p>You can start working after you've created a remote repository, for example, on GitHub. For
    this, you should clone the repository to your computer. You can do it with the <code>git clone</code>
    command:
</p>
<pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/dream_team/project.git</code></pre>
<p>
    The syntax is as follows: first, we type the command <code>git clone</code> and then add the address of
    the remote repository on the server, in this case, this is the <code>dream_team</code> repository on
    GitHub, where there is a new <code>project.git</code>. This way, you will get the whole repository with
    all its content. But for the very first time, it naturally will be empty.</p><p>Cool, now you have a working area,
    and you can get down to coding! And then, there will be time to get the new data to the server. For this, you will
    need the <code>git push</code> command.</p><h4>Git push</h4><p>Git push is sending data, meaning
    commits and branches, to the server, to a remote repository. That is, every time you make some changes to the code
    and commit them, you can and should upload the updated data to the server. This way your colleagues will always see
    the current version of the code. And It is also essential to have such a backup in case of data loss on your
    computer.</p><p>The command syntax is as follows:<code>git push origin &lt;branch_name&gt;</code>. This
    means you push the data to the remote server (origin) and push it to a concrete branch. In the example below, this
    is the <code>main</code> branch:</p>
<pre><code>$ git push origin main</code></pre>
<p>If you want,
    you can push on another branch. If there is no such branch on the server, then it will be created. If you have
    already pushed it before, then new commits will simply be sent there, and in this case, you can use short versions
    of the command: just <code>git push</code>.<br>
    And please do not forget, that before you push the changes, you should commit them first.</p><p>Okay, now you've
    pushed your changes to the server. But what about the opposite situation when you need to download them from the
    server? You've probably guessed it: you may clone the repository one more time by <code>git
        clone</code>, but it will copy all the changes ever committed. What if you are interested only in the latest
    changes that are more actual? Then you should use the <code>git pull</code> command.</p><h4>Git
    pull</h4><p>Git pull is downloading data from the server and only the most recent one. This way, you won't get
    confused about the commits and will be sure you only copied the freshest and most current of them. So, you just do:
    <code>git pull origin &lt;branch_name&gt;</code>, i.e., you download the latest changes from the remote
    repository branch on the server. In the example, we download data from the <code>main</code> branch.
</p>
<pre><code>$ git pull origin main</code></pre>
<p>You can choose
    all the branches you need and use a short version of the command. Just write a <code>git pull</code> if
    the local branch already belongs to some remote branch from which you are downloading the changes.</p><p>Awesome,
    now with all the latest changes, you can start making your own and push them again. And so on in a circle, until the
    project is finished. However, in a large project with a lot of constant changes, there may arise some problems.
    Let's discuss one of the most frequent ones below to understand why it happens and how it can be solved.</p><h4>Git
    push rejected</h4><p>This problem arises sooner or later if you and your team are working with git on a regular
    basis. And it goes like this: you make a new commit, try to push it, and git throws you a <code>git
        push rejected error</code> in response. This happens to you if someone has made changes you didn't pull yet. Git
    is designed so that we can commit as many times as we want but only locally. Before you send your commits to the
    server, you need to pull new commits from it. The ones that your colleagues did. That is, do a <code>git
        pull</code>, and the problem is solved!</p><h4>Conclusion</h4><p>Now you know how to clone a remote repository
    from the server using the <code>git clone</code> command, how to upload changes to the server using the
    <code>git push</code> command, and how to download the most recent updates using the <code
    >git pull</code> command.</p>
