<h2>Starting with Git</h2>
<p>In this topic, we will start exploring Git, the essential tool to control and merge your code versions. We will learn
    what Git is, why we need to use it, and how to install it on the three major operating systems.</p>

<h4>What is Git?</h4>
<p><strong>Git</strong> is a distributed version control system that helps developers track and record changes in the
    files. These can be any files one wants to work with, but we will take a closer look at the source codes of
    programs. With Git, you can roll back to an older version of your project, compare it, analyze, and merge changes.
    This process is called <em>version control</em>.
</p>
<p>Git is<em> distributed</em>, that is, it doesn't depend on a single central server that stores files. Instead, it
    works entirely locally, storing data in folders on your hard drive called a <strong>repository</strong>. This is
    called the <em>local</em> repository existing only on your hard drive. However, you can keep a copy of it online,
    which makes it a lot easier for multiple people to work on the same project. In that case, it is called a
    <em>remote</em> repository.
</p>


<p>A number of services provide hosting for Git repositories, among the most famous are
    <a href="https://github.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a>,
    <a href="https://bitbucket.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Bitbucket</a> and
    <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">GitLab</a>. Further, we
    will discuss only GitHub as the most popular among these resources. Anyway, if you want, you may use the others
    listed above instead.</p>

<p>
    Git is a free and open-source software primarily developed for Linux, but it also supports most major operating
    systems, including macOS and Windows. Now we will learn how to install Git on these systems.

<h4>Installing Git</h4>

<p><strong>1. Windows</strong></p>
<p>There are several ways to install Git on Windows. First, you can go to the
    <a href="https://git-scm.com/download/win" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">official Git site</a>,
    and the download will start automatically. After installation, you need to select the options you need in the
    settings.</p>
<p>For unattended installation, you can also use the
    <a href="https://chocolatey.org/packages/git" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Git Chocolatey
        package</a>.</p>
<p>Another easy way to install Git is to install GitHub for Windows. Its installer includes command-line utilities and
    GUI Git. You can download GitHub for Windows from the
    <a href="https://desktop.github.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub Desktop website</a>.
</p>

<p><strong>2. Linux</strong></p>
<p>You can just open a terminal and install the application using your distribution's package manager. If you have
    Fedora (or another similar distribution such as RHEL or CentOS), you can use <code>dnf</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo dnf install git-all</code></pre>
<p>If you have a Debian-based distribution like Ubuntu, try <code>apt</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo apt install git</code></pre>

<p><strong>3. macOS</strong></p>
<p>There are several ways to install Git on Mac.</p>
<p>You may install the <code>Xcode Command Line Tools</code> by typing the following command in your terminal:</p>
<pre><code>xcode-select --install</code></pre>
<p>Then you can simply check if Git is already installed:</p>
<pre><code>$ git --version</code></pre>
<p>If Git is not installed, you will be prompted to install it.</p>
<p>The other way is to use <code>homebrew</code>, which can be installed from the terminal using the command below:</p>
<pre><code>/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"</code></pre>
<p>More information on <code>homebrew</code> can be found on the
    <a href="https://brew.sh/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">homebrew official website</a>. After
    installing it, run in the terminal:
</p>
<pre><code>brew install git</code></pre>
<p>You can also install Git when installing GitHub for Mac. Their GUI Git tool has an option to install command line
    tools as well. You can download the
    <a href="https://desktop.github.com" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub client for Mac</a>.
</p>

<h4>Git settings</h4>
<p>So, we have successfully installed Git, now we need to adjust some settings. There are quite a few options to play
    with, but we'll set up the most important ones: our username and email address. Open the terminal and run the
    commands:
</p>
<pre><code>git config --global user.name "My Name"
git config --global user.email myEmail@example.com</code>
</pre>
<p>Now each of our actions will be marked with our name and e-mail address. Thus, users will always know who is
    responsible for certain changes: this brings order!</p>

<h4>Git check</h4>
<p>Usually, the installation is successful, but just in case, we recommend you to check that the latest version of Git
    has actually been installed by running the <code>git --version</code> command in the terminal. The result will be
    something like the following:</p>
<pre><code>git version 2.33.1</code></pre>
<div class="alert alert-primary">
    Versions are updated, so you may have a different one. In our example, this is the <em>2.33.1</em> version.
</div>
<p>It means that Git is installed, and you can start working with it.</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>Let's sum up what you've learned on this topic:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Git is a set of console utilities to store, control, change and merge your codes.</li>
    <li>You can easily install it on Windows, Linux, or macOS.</li>
    <li>With Git, you can keep your projects either locally on your hard drive or using an online service.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, since you are familiar with Git, you might be interested to discover more about it in the next topics. But
    first, let's get to some tasks!
