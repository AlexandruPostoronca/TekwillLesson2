<h2>Git branches</h2><p>Now it's time to find out how the copies of the projects we store with git are organized. In
    this topic we will familiarize ourselves with branching, why is it needed, and what we can do with it.</p><h4>
    Branching</h4><p>Sometimes it is useful to develop modules separately or to create an alternative project version to
    see if it's better than the previous one. In such cases, it is good practice to work with a copy of the original
    project, which is called a <strong>branch</strong>. Branches have their own history and changes isolated from each
    other until you decide to merge them. There are several reasons to have it this way:</p>
<ul>
    <li>the already working, stable version of the code is saved,</li>
    <li>various new functions can be developed in parallel by different programmers,</li>
    <li>developers can work with their own branches without the risk that the codebase will change due to someone else's
        changes,
    </li>
    <li>in case of doubt, you can develop different implementations of the same idea in different branches and then
        compare them.
    </li>
</ul><p>In other words, branching is the ability to split versions of one project and work with them separately.</p><p>
    How do you create a branch? The main branch in each repository is called a <strong>master </strong>branch. To create
    another branch, use the <code>branch &lt;name&gt;</code> command:</p>
<pre><code>$ git branch new_branch</code></pre><p>This will create a new branch,
    which is, for now, an exact copy of the master branch. You can change it later and get a new version of the code
    without affecting the main one. So, in case of errors and failures, just switch to the master and continue working
    in it, or, alternatively, create another branch because their number is not limited.</p><h4>Switching between
    branches</h4><p>If we run <code>git branch</code>, there will be two options:</p>
<pre><code>$ git branch
new_branch
* master</code></pre><p>Master is the active branch and is therefore marked with an asterisk. But since we want to work
    with our new branch, we need to switch to it. For this, we use the <code>git checkout</code> command,
    which takes only one parameter: the name of our new branch.</p>
<pre><code>$ git checkout new_branch</code></pre><h4>Merging branches</h4><p>So,
    you've switched to a new branch, now you can start working with it. For example, you can add and commit a new
    documentation file for a new version of the project code.</p>
<pre><code>$ git add new_documentation.txt
$ git commit -m "New documentation version complete!‚Äù</code></pre><p> Since the changes are completed, we can switch
    back to the master branch:</p>
<pre><code>$ git checkout master</code></pre><p>Now, if we open our project in
    the file manager, we will not see the <code>new_documentation.txt</code> file, because we switched back
    to the master branch where such a file does not exist. In case you need to put the files from a new version to the
    main one, use the <code>git merge</code> command. <strong>Merging</strong> just means applying changes
    from the new branch to the main version of the project.</p>
<pre><code>$ git merge new_branch</code></pre><p>If it no longer makes sense to
    store new changes separately, and they have already become part of the master, the branch can be deleted using the
    <code>git branch -d</code> command, where <code>-d</code> means <em>delete</em>:</p>
<pre><code>$ git branch -d new_branch</code></pre><h4>Resolving merge
    conflicts</h4><p>Conflicts can occur when merging branches. The most common situation is when one file has been
    committed twice. Let's look at a version conflict in more detail. For example, the main branch had an <code
    >initial.file</code> with the formula<code> e = mc^4</code>. In addition, there
    were two other branches. In the first one, there was a file with the right version of the formula <code
    >e = mc^2</code>, and in the second one, there was a file with the wrong version of the formula
    <code>e = mc^3</code>.</p><p>The programmer tried to merge all of these branches together using the
    merge commands:</p>
<pre><code>git merge origin/fix-formula-wrong
git merge origin/fix-formula-right</code></pre><p>As a result, they received the following error:</p>
<pre><code>Auto-merging initial.file
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in initial.file
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result</code></pre><p>And in the file on the main branch,
    there was already such a formula <code>e = mc^3</code>. If they cancel all their changes, they will get
    the formula <code>e = mc^4</code> again, which is not correct. As a result, their output is to correct
    the formula with their hands and commit the already correct result, namely the formula <code>e =
        mc^2</code>.</p><p>As you can see, the process is quite tedious and can be very difficult on large projects.

        conflicts</a>, but it isn't necessary for simple ones like the one we discussed here.</p><p>Anyway, before doing
    anything, it is better to discuss it with your colleagues.</p><h4>Conclusion</h4><p>Let's sum up what you've learned
    in this topic:</p>
<ul>
    <li>a copy of the original project is called a branch; to create a branch, use <code>git branch &lt;branch
        name&gt;</code> command;
    </li>
    <li>to switch between branches, use <code>git checkout</code> command;</li>
    <li>merging branches means applying changes from one branch to another; to merge, use <code>git
        merge</code> command;
    </li>
    <li>use <code>git branch -d</code> to delete a branch;</li>
    <li>when merging branches, conflicts may occur; be attentive and keep track of all your actions and the actions of
        your colleagues if it is a group project.
    </li>
